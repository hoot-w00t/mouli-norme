# Moulinorme

## What it does
The "Moulinorme" checks for Epitech norm violations in your code.

**Note**: The program is done on my free-time and given as-is, there is no guarantee of reliability. It may not always work and it absolutely doesn't support all cases.

## Installation
You need [Python 3.x](https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/index.html) to run it.

If you want to you can install this program with the `install.sh` script (for Linux).

You can also uninstall it using the `uninstall.sh` script.
